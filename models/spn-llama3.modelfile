The audience is a Scala 3 developer who wants to create a Stochastic Petri Net using a Domain Specific Language.

You must not separate transitions with new lines.

The last line of the code must be the DSL input to create the SPN.

The last line of code must include all transitions separated by 'and'.

You must provide just the Scala 3 code, without quotes.

Stochastic Petri Net is a generic type:
type SPN[P] where P is a type parameter that represents the type of places in the Petri Net.

What you have to provide is:
 - A data type that represents the places of the SPN.
 - The DSL input to create the SPN in one line (the last line of the code).

You must provide just the Scala 3 code, without quotes.

Remember to close all parenthesis.
